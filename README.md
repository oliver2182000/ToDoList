# ToDoList
This is a single page aplication created using React JS that satisfies the actions of CREATE, EDIT and DELETE a task introduced by the user at any given moment. The app is conected to a database which means our task will be stored even after we have closed the aplication. 
# Backend
For the backend process I used MySql as my database manager to store all the data in one single table that takes values of id, tasks, descriptions of the task and the dates parameters required by Sequelize. We make a connection between the database and our app using sequelize datatypes in order to make changes in the database and store our data. As a final step we create our API and make the necessary set ups to our routes and our server using Cors and Express.

*Cors: 2.8.5

*Express:4.17.3

*Mysql: 2.18.1

*Sequelize: 6.19.0

# Frontend
*axios: 0.26.1
*bootstrap: 5.1.3
*react: 18.0.0
